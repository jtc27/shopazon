You can click "Add to Cart" and a green notification will appear showing the item that you added.  In the top right there is also a counter that shows how many items are in your shopping cart.  **If you try to check out as a guest, the site will remind you to login.**

Checkout is also simulated, with a non-real address and credit card.  When you "Place your order" it will notify you of a completed order and reset the shopping cart to empty.
